Steps to Design and Develop a Custom Application in Salesforce Cloud:

1. Access Salesforce Cloud:
   - Go to developer.salesforce.com.
   - Sign up for a new account or log in.

2. Explore the Salesforce Interface:
   - Familiarize yourself with the app launcher, setup menu, object manager, settings, and profile options.

3. Create Objects (Tables):
   - Navigate to the Object Manager.
   - Create custom objects (e.g., Student, Book) to store your application's data.
   - Define object properties like labels and descriptions.
   - Note that custom object names end with "_c".

4. Add Fields (Columns) to Objects:
   - For each object, add fields to define the data it will hold (e.g., Author, Publisher for the Book object; Name, Email for the Student object).
   - Choose appropriate data types for each field (e.g., Text, Email, Number).
   - Configure field properties like length, description, and whether it's required or unique.

5. Create Tabs:
   - Go to "Setup" and find "Tabs".
   - Create tabs for your custom objects to make them accessible within the application.
   - Select a style for your tabs.

6. Create the App:
   - In "Setup," find "App Manager".
   - Create a new Lightning App.
   - Give your app a name and description (e.g., "Library Management System").
   - Optionally, add a logo.
   - Choose the supported form factors (desktop and/or phone).
   - Include the tabs you created in your app.
   - Set user profile access for the app.

7. Access and Test Your Application:
   - Find your newly created application using the App Launcher.
   - Test the application by adding records to your custom objects through the created tabs.
